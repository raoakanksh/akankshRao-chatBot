**My First Chatbot**
This repository contains a Streamlit-based chatbot that allows users to upload PDF files, extract text from them, and ask questions about the content. The chatbot uses OpenAI's language model to provide answers based on the uploaded documents. The system leverages several key technologies, including LangChain for natural language processing and FAISS for efficient similarity search.

**Features**
PDF Upload: Users can upload PDF files, and the text content is extracted using PyPDF2.

Text Processing: The extracted text is split into manageable chunks using LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.

Embeddings Generation: Text chunks are converted into embeddings using OpenAI's embeddings model.

Vector Store: FAISS is used to store and search embeddings, enabling efficient retrieval of relevant text chunks based on user queries.

Question Answering: The chatbot uses OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo model to answer user questions by comparing the query with the stored text embeddings.
Getting Started

To get started with the chatbot, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Install Dependencies:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up API Key:
Replace OPEN_AI_API_KEY in the code with your actual OpenAI API key.

**Run the Application:**
arduino
Copy code
streamlit run chatbot.py
Upload a PDF and Ask Questions:

Navigate to the Streamlit app in your browser.
Upload a PDF file and start asking questions in the input field.
Dependencies
Streamlit: For creating the web app interface.
PyPDF2: For reading and extracting text from PDF files.
LangChain: For text splitting, embeddings, and integrating with OpenAI's models.
FAISS: For efficient similarity search and retrieval of relevant text chunks.
